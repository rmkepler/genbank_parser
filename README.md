#These scripts help manage genbank submissions and handling the returned voucher information. 'alignment_parser.pl' takes an alignment in fasta format and prunes out sequences whose name is not found in the accompanying table. 'parseGBnum.pl' parses the information Genbank sends back when you get your accession numbers.  The intent is to take the three columns of information (file sequencename GBnumber) and make it a nice little tab delimited file with information for each sequence name on a line.
